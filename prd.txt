## Project Title

**Tariff Impact Radar: Visualizing Canadian Companies at Risk from U.S. Tariffs**

## Hackathon Tracks

* **Best Use of Data Visualization**
* **Best Use of AI for Good**

## 1. Problem Statement

Canadian companies are significantly affected by U.S. tariffs, but the data describing *who* is most at risk, *why*, and *how severely* is fragmented, technical, and difficult for non-experts to interpret. Policymakers, journalists, investors, and the public lack a clear, accessible way to understand the real-world impact of trade policy on Canadian businesses and workers.

## 2. Goal & Vision

Build an interactive, AI-powered data visualization platform that:

* Identifies Canadian companies and sectors most exposed to U.S. tariffs
* Clearly explains *why* they are at risk (supply chains, export dependency, tariff categories)
* Quantifies and visualizes potential economic impact
* Makes trade data understandable and actionable for non-technical users

This project aims to increase transparency, support informed decision-making, and promote evidence-based policy discussions.

## 3. Target Users

* **Policy makers & government analysts** – Assess trade exposure and economic risk
* **Journalists & researchers** – Quickly identify impacted sectors and companies
* **Investors & analysts** – Evaluate tariff-related risk
* **General public & students** – Learn how tariffs affect the Canadian economy

## 4. User Needs & Use Cases

### Core User Questions

* Which Canadian companies are most at risk from U.S. tariffs?
* Which industries and regions are most affected?
* What factors drive a company’s risk score?
* How would tariff increases or removals change the risk landscape?

### Example Use Cases

* A journalist exploring which provinces are most affected by steel or lumber tariffs
* A policy analyst simulating a new tariff scenario
* A student learning about international trade through interactive visuals

## 5. Key Features

### 5.1 Data Aggregation & Composition

* Combine multiple datasets, including:

  * Canadian export data by company/sector
  * U.S. tariff schedules (HS codes)
  * Company financials (revenue, export dependence)
  * Employment and regional economic data

### 5.2 AI-Powered Risk Scoring (AI for Good)

* Generate a **Tariff Risk Score** per company using AI models

* Factors may include:

  * Percentage of revenue from U.S. exports
  * Exposure to tariffed goods
  * Supply chain concentration
  * Company size and resilience indicators

* AI-generated plain-language explanations:

  * “This company is high risk because 65% of revenue comes from tariffed aluminum exports to the U.S.”

### 5.3 Interactive Data Visualizations (Data Viz Track)

* **National Overview Dashboard**

  * Heatmap of Canada by province
  * Industry-level exposure charts

* **Company-Level View**

  * Risk score breakdown
  * Revenue exposure graphs
  * Timeline of tariff changes

* **Scenario Explorer**

  * Sliders to simulate tariff increases/decreases
  * Real-time visual updates

### 5.4 Search & Filters

* Search by company name
* Filter by industry, province, risk level

## 6. AI Responsibilities & Ethics

* AI is used for:

  * Risk scoring and pattern detection
  * Natural-language explanations of complex data
  * Scenario analysis

* Guardrails:

  * Clear explanation that results are estimates, not predictions
  * Transparent methodology and feature importance
  * No proprietary or private company data

## 7. Success Metrics

### Hackathon Success

* Judges clearly understand the problem and impact within 2 minutes
* Visualizations are intuitive without explanation
* Clear demonstration of AI adding meaningful insight (not just automation)

### Product Metrics

* Time to insight (how quickly users identify at-risk companies)
* Engagement with interactive scenarios
* Clarity ratings from user feedback

## 8. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

* Real-time stock price prediction
* Confidential or private company data
* Legal or financial advice

## 9. Technical Overview (High-Level)

* **Frontend:** Interactive web dashboard (charts, maps, filters)
* **Backend:** Data processing and AI scoring pipeline
* **AI Layer:** Model for risk scoring + explanation generation
* **Data Sources:** Public trade, tariff, and economic datasets

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                              | Mitigation                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data gaps or outdated tariff data | Use latest public datasets and clearly label timestamps |
| Over-reliance on AI output        | Provide transparent methodology and visual breakdowns   |
| Complexity for users              | Default views + guided explanations                     |

## 11. Why This Wins “AI for Good”

* Improves transparency around trade policy impacts
* Helps communities understand economic vulnerability
* Supports better policy and public discourse

## 12. Why This Wins “Best Data Visualization”

* Turns dense, technical trade data into intuitive visuals
* Allows exploration across geography, industry, and time
* Makes complex cause-and-effect relationships visible
